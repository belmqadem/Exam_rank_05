## Important Notes

1. **Milestone Achievement**

This exam is the penultimate step in your curriculum. If you’ve made it this far, congratulations! Your hard work and dedication have brought you to this advanced level, and there’s only one exam left to complete your journey.

2. **Pointer Deletion in cpp_module_02**

During the final exercise of cpp_module_02, it’s critical to avoid manually deleting pointers in the exam. The testing program (grademe) already handles the deletion. If you attempt to delete pointers yourself, it may result in segmentation faults because the program might try to delete the same pointers again.

## Final Encouragement

This exam is a testament to your skills and perseverance. You’re so close to the finish line—stay focused, give it your best effort, and success will follow. Good luck!
